geopandas, pyogrio, and fiona are useful for working with GeoJSON files and shapefiles (used to add state boundaries).

shapely and numpy are often used as dependencies by geopandas and folium.

If you're only running the base map and charts (without shapefile operations), you can omit geopandas, pyogrio, and fiona.
